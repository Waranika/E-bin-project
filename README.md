### Challenge

There are hundreds of ways that we can all go a little bit lighter on this planet, and our Green Hacks challenge encourages you make them real.  Whether you want to focus on clean energy, smarter recycling, preventing waste, or even cleaning up the messes that we leave behind, every drop of oil left unburned or gadget kept out of the landfill helps keep our world running a little cleaner.  Here's your chance to hack for the planet.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a smart trash can that can sort waste.

The project is divided into two parts:
- The first part is the creation of a smart trash can that can detect the type of waste thrown in it.
- The second part is the creation of a machine learning model that can detect the type of waste from it dielectric value.
